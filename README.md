🧩 A call to unite the Linux community around better hardware support — open letter, ideas, and collaboration hub.
An Open Letter to the Linux Community: Hardware Support Is the Last Frontier
This is not a complaint. It’s a rallying cry.

To the developers, maintainers, and leaders of Debian, Red Hat, Arch, Fedora, and the wider Linux ecosystem:

We are a growing wave of users making the bold transition away from Windows, drawn by the promise of freedom, performance, and control. We commend your relentless work in building fast, efficient, and secure operating systems. You’ve created a world-class foundation. But one critical frontier remains: hardware support.

Across forums, issue trackers, and social platforms, one theme echoes louder than others: “My Wi-Fi doesn’t work.” “My GPU isn’t accelerating.” “My laptop fans go crazy.” “There’s no driver.” These are not minor inconveniences — they are roadblocks. For many, they are deal-breakers.

Linux may be rock-solid under the hood, but for newcomers and everyday users, the lack of reliable out-of-the-box hardware compatibility creates a steep and frustrating barrier. In 2025, users shouldn’t have to choose between digital freedom and working hardware.

We get it. It’s not easy.
Hardware vendors often guard their documentation. Drivers are proprietary. Firmware blobs are scattered. Support varies wildly between brands and devices. But that’s exactly why we’re writing this letter — because the time has come to turn this challenge into a movement.

We’re not just asking the Linux community to expect better from manufacturers — we’re asking you to lead the charge.

Here’s what we’re calling for:
🤝 Forge partnerships with hardware vendors — even small ones — to build trust and pipelines for collaboration.

💰 Create funding models or bounties to accelerate driver development and reverse engineering efforts.

🛠️ Offer user-friendly tools to detect hardware, report issues, and collect logs with one click.

🧭 Unify compatibility initiatives across distributions to reduce duplication and improve documentation.

🧑‍💻 Empower the community — mentor, onboard, and spotlight contributors working on hardware layers.

You’ve already won the developers. Now win the desktops.
The Linux desktop has never been more promising — lightweight, private, customizable. But to truly compete, it needs to “just work” for the next billion users.

We’re not demanding perfection. We’re asking for momentum. For direction. For a shared vision that puts hardware compatibility at the core of the Linux experience.

We’re here. We’re passionate. We’re ready to help.

Are you ready to lead?

Sincerely,
Anons_v69 
and the growing wave of everyday Linux users
